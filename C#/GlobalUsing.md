## Detailed Steps

### 1. Introduction to Global Usings
- **Read**: Overview of global usings in C# from the official [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-10#global-using-directives).
- **Understand**:
  - Global usings are a feature introduced in C# 10 that allow you to specify namespaces to be available globally across your project, eliminating the need to repeatedly include them in every file.
  - They help to simplify and reduce boilerplate code in large projects by consolidating common namespace imports.

### 2. Declaring and Using Global Usings
- **Learn**:
  - Basic syntax for declaring global usings.
    ```csharp
    global using System;
    global using System.Collections.Generic;
    ```
  - Placement of global usings.
    - Typically placed in a file called `GlobalUsings.cs` in the root of the project or a `usings` folder.
  - Examples of common global usings.
    ```csharp
    // GlobalUsings.cs
    global using System;
    global using System.Collections.Generic;
    global using System.Linq;
    global using System.Threading.Tasks;
    global using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
    ```

### 3. Practical Examples
- **Example 1**: Simplifying project files with global usings.
  - Before global usings:
    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;

    namespace MyApp
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main()
            {
                List<string> names = new List<string> { "Alice", "Bob" };
                Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", names));
            }
        }
    }
    ```
  - After adding global usings:
    ```csharp
    // GlobalUsings.cs
    global using System;
    global using System.Collections.Generic;

    // Program.cs
    namespace MyApp
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main()
            {
                List<string> names = new List<string> { "Alice", "Bob" };
                Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", names));
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- **Example 2**: Using global usings in a web application.
  - Consolidate common ASP.NET Core namespaces into a global usings file.
    ```csharp
    // GlobalUsings.cs
    global using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
    global using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
    global using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
    global using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
    global using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
    ```

### 4. Best Practices and Advanced Features
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use global usings for common namespaces that are used across many files.
  - Keep the `GlobalUsings.cs` file organized and up-to-date.
  - Avoid overusing global usings to keep the project manageable and avoid namespace conflicts.
- **Combining with Regular Usings**:
  - You can still use regular `using` directives in files for namespaces that are specific to that file.
    ```csharp
    // GlobalUsings.cs
    global using System;

    // Specific file
    using MyApp.Helpers;

    namespace MyApp
    {
        // File-specific code here
    }
    ```
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Using global usings has minimal impact on performance, but keeping the global usings list concise can help maintain readability.
- **Troubleshooting Common Issues**:
  - Ensure there are no conflicting namespaces.
  - Keep an eye on namespace pollution if too many global usings are defined.
